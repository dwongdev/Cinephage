## Docker Installation (Recommended)

Docker provides the simplest setup and automatic updates.

### Quick Start

1. Download the files:

   ```bash
   mkdir cinephage && cd cinephage
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoldyTaint/cinephage/main/docker-compose.yaml
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoldyTaint/cinephage/main/.env.example
   ```

2. Create your configuration:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Edit `.env` and set your media path:

   ```bash
   CINEPHAGE_MEDIA_PATH=/path/to/your/media
   ```

4. Start Cinephage:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

Open http://localhost:3000

### Configuration Options

All settings go in `.env`. All Docker variables use the `CINEPHAGE_` prefix:

| Variable               | Required | Default               | Description                   |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `CINEPHAGE_MEDIA_PATH` | Yes      | -                     | Path to your media library    |
| `CINEPHAGE_UID`        | No       | 1000                  | User ID for file permissions  |
| `CINEPHAGE_GID`        | No       | 1000                  | Group ID for file permissions |
| `CINEPHAGE_PORT`       | No       | 3000                  | Port to expose                |
| `CINEPHAGE_ORIGIN`     | No       | http://localhost:3000 | Your access URL               |
| `CINEPHAGE_TZ`         | No       | UTC                   | Timezone                      |

Data, configuration, and logs are stored under `/config` in the container. Mount a host directory to `/config` to persist them. Avoid mounting `/app`, which contains the application files.

> **Upgrade note:** If you previously mounted `/app/data` and `/app/logs`, run one start with both the old mounts **and** `/config` mounted. The entrypoint will copy existing data/logs into `/config`, then you can remove the old mounts. If migration fails due to permissions, rerun once as root (`user: 0:0` or `--user 0:0`) and set `PUID`/`PGID`.

#### Entrypoint Ownership (Advanced)

These variables are read directly by the container entrypoint (no `CINEPHAGE_` prefix). They only take effect when the container starts as root (for example, no `user:` flag in Compose or `--user` in `docker run`).

| Variable | Required | Default | Description                 |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| `PUID`   | No       | 1000    | Runtime user ID to drop to  |
| `PGID`   | No       | 1000    | Runtime group ID to drop to |

At startup, the entrypoint ensures ownership for `/config` and `/home/node/.cache` matches the runtime UID/GID, which covers config/data/logs and cached browser downloads.

### Using Docker Run

When using `docker run` directly, pass the application variables (`ORIGIN`, `TZ`) since there's no `.env` file:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name cinephage \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --user 1000:1000 \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ./config:/config \
  -v /path/to/your/media:/media \
  -e ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 \
  -e TZ=UTC \
  ghcr.io/moldytaint/cinephage:latest
```

> **Note:** The `CINEPHAGE_*` prefix is only used in `.env` files for Docker Compose. When using `docker run`, pass the actual application variables (`ORIGIN`, `TZ`) directly.
>
> If you need the entrypoint to fix ownership on bind mounts, start the container as root (omit `--user`) and set `PUID`/`PGID`.

### Synology NAS Users

Synology's Docker implementation has a known quirk with the `HOME` directory environment variable that can cause installation failures. When using the user: flag with a custom UID/GID, Synology doesn't properly preserve the container's HOME directory, leading to permission errors during Camoufox installation.

#### Recommended Configuration Options

> **Note:** Ensure all bind-mounted directories exist and have proper permissions before starting the container.

##### Option 1: Run as Default 1000:1000 User (Recommended)

The container automatically runs as UID/GID `1000:1000` by default. For this option, do **not** set a `user:` flag **and** do **not** define `PUID`/`PGID` environment variables; simply rely on the built-in user.

> **Note:** Synology uses its own ACL system that doesn't translate directly to Unix permissions. Even if you pass your Synology UID/GID or PUID/PGID via environment variables, the container will still effectively run as `1000:1000` inside the container due to permission mapping quirks.

```yml
services:
  cinephage:
    image: ghcr.io/moldytaint/cinephage:latest
    container_name: cinephage
    restart: unless-stopped
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    environment:
      - TZ=America/New_York
      - ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
    volumes:
      - /volume1/docker/cinephage/config:/config
      - /volume1/docker/media:/media
      - /volume1/docker/downloads:/downloads
```

##### Option 2: Run with Specific User Flag

If you prefer using the `user:` flag, your options are limited to `0:0` (root) or `1000:1000` (non-root). The container will automatically downgrade to the non-root user `1000:1000` at runtime even if you set the user flag to `0:0`.

```yml
services:
  cinephage:
    image: ghcr.io/moldytaint/cinephage:latest
    container_name: cinephage
    restart: unless-stopped
    user: 1000:1000
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    environment:
      - TZ=America/New_York
      - ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
    volumes:
      - /volume1/docker/cinephage/config:/config
      - /volume1/docker/media:/media
      - /volume1/docker/downloads:/downloads
```

##### Option 3: Root User with Custom Synology UID/GID

This workaround starts the container as root (allowing the entrypoint script to run properly) then safely downgrades to your specified Synology UID/GID.

```yml
services:
  cinephage:
    image: ghcr.io/moldytaint/cinephage:latest
    container_name: cinephage
    restart: unless-stopped
    user: 0:0
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    environment:
      - PUID=1026 # Your Synology user ID
      - PGID=100 # Your Synology group ID
      - TZ=America/New_York
      - ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
    volumes:
      - /volume1/docker/cinephage/config:/config
      - /volume1/docker/media:/media
      - /volume1/docker/downloads:/downloads
```

### Building from Source

To build the Docker image yourself instead of using the pre-built image:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MoldyTaint/cinephage.git
cd cinephage
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set MEDIA_PATH
# Then edit docker-compose.yaml: uncomment "build: ." and comment out "image:"
docker compose up -d --build
```

---

## Manual Installation

For running without Docker or for development.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MoldyTaint/cinephage.git
cd cinephage
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build the Application

```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

Cinephage is now running at **http://localhost:3000**.

The database initializes automatically on first run at `data/cinephage.db`.

---

## Installing ffprobe (Optional)

ffprobe enables media info extraction for resolution, codec, and audio track details. Without it, Cinephage can still function but won't detect quality information from existing files.

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Windows:**
Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add to PATH.

If ffprobe is not in your system PATH, set the `FFPROBE_PATH` environment variable to its location.

---

## Verify Installation

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. You should see the Cinephage interface prompting you for initial setup.

If the page doesn't load:

- Check that port 3000 is not in use by another application
- Review the logs (`logs/` directory or `docker logs cinephage`)
- See [Troubleshooting](../support/troubleshooting.md) for common issues
